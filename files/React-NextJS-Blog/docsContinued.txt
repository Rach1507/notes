React core concepts : components , state, props 

Components 
- Ui - broken down - building blocks 
- pieces of ui 
- reusable 
- Self contained 
- Lego brick analogy 
- Capital letter - diff from normal func
- Use using <> like html 
- Nest 

Modularity - allows code to be more maintainabl -  update , add without affecting others 

Javascript 
Components - Function that return Jsx( ui element) 
Nest the components - Tree -
This modular format allows you to reuse components in different places inside your app.

But think about reusing - if u use th same 2 times - same thing is rendered 
What if u wanted it with diff data 

Just like how we pass attributes to html 

Href to a 

Similarly , 
In the same way, you can pass pieces of information as properties to React components. These are called props

props - properties 
- pieces of information 
- Passed to react 

On the consumer side - 
React component - js fun - custom arguments
- To be designed to accept custom components 
- These props - change ui , component's behavior
- Passed further down 
- Recieve it - destructor it - use it 
* You need a way to tell React that this is a JavaScript variable.
* Use it within {}

Data rendering model -  In React, data flows down the component tree. 
This is referred to as one-way data flow

If you run this code, 
React will give us a warning about a missing key prop. 
This is because React needs something to uniquely identify items in an array so it knows which elements to update in the DOM.

Interactivity - add 
- Html - where will user interest 
- Listen to event - camelCase - 
- Handle event - above return

Hook - set of functions 
State - piece of info ass with comp. - that will change overtime - 
the React hook used to manage state is called: useState()

Log a plain old - const stateResult = useState(“”);


Nextjs - has prewritten code to define routes 
App - index 
Layout js - common - header and footer , nv=avbar 

 
Server components - 
Client components - 

To understand the Diff- 2 environments ]

Client - 
Server
Netwrok boundary 
React - u can define new boundary 
Choose what has to be rendered and sent on server - 
What needs to be rendered on ui 


Choose what has to be rendered and sent on server -  why ??? - reduce code sent to client app , improves performance , 
 Next.js uses Server Components by default
= improve your application's performance 
=s you don't have to take additional steps to adopt them.


Move it 'use client';
Fast refresh
